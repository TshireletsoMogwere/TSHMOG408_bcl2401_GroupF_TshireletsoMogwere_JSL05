# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

### Galaxy Playlist Generator

In this challenge, you'll combine your knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Your task is to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.


1. **Expand the Songs Array**: Add at least five songs to the `songs` array, each with `title`, `artist`, and `genre`.
2. **Assign Preferences**: Complete the `guardians` object by assigning each Guardian their preferred music genre.
3. **Generate Playlists**: Implement the `generatePlaylist` function. Use the `map()` function to create a personalized playlist for each Guardian based on their genre preference.
4. **Display Playlists**: Dynamically create and append elements to the `#playlists` div to display each Guardian's playlist. Include the Guardian's name and their list of songs.
5. **Test Your Application**: Ensure that your application correctly filters songs by genre for each Guardian and displays the playlists on the web page.



This challenge will test your ability to manipulate arrays and objects, use the `map()` function for data transformation, and dynamically update the DOM based on data. Good luck, and may your mix be truly awesome!
