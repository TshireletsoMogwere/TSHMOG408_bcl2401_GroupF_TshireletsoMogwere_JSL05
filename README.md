# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

# Learning Experience Readme

## Introduction

In this document, I'll share my learning experience while working on a specific project, detailing the challenges faced, solutions found, and insights gained throughout the process. 

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: The objective of the project was to implement a playlist generator that creates playlists for different guardians based on their preferred music genres.
- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript (ES6), HTML, CSS.

## Learning Experience

### Challenges Faced

1. **Understanding Object Iteration**: Initially, I faced challenges in iterating through objects efficiently, especially when dealing with the `guardians` object and filtering songs based on each guardian's genre preference.
   
2. **Dynamic HTML Generation**: Generating dynamic HTML elements to display the playlists posed a challenge, especially ensuring the structure was correct and each playlist was displayed accurately.

### Solutions Found

1. **Object Entries and Iteration**: I learned about the `Object.entries()` method in JavaScript, which helped me iterate through the `guardians` object effectively. This, combined with array methods like `forEach` and `filter`, simplified the process of filtering songs based on guardians' preferences.

2. **Creating HTML Elements Dynamically**: To dynamically create HTML elements, I utilized the `document.createElement()` method in conjunction with DOM manipulation techniques. This allowed me to create divs, headings, and list elements dynamically based on the playlists generated.

### Insights Gained

1. **Enhanced JavaScript Proficiency**: Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts such as object iteration, array methods, and DOM manipulation. This enhanced my proficiency in JavaScript programming.

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Dealing with challenges such as object iteration and dynamic HTML generation improved my problem-solving skills. I learned to break down complex problems into manageable tasks and find effective solutions.

3. **Application of Concepts**: The project provided an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of JavaScript in a practical scenario. This hands-on experience was invaluable in solidifying my understanding of the language.

## Conclusion

Working on this project was a rewarding learning experience. It not only helped me strengthen my JavaScript skills but also improved my problem-solving abilities and gave me confidence in tackling similar projects in the future.
